hello! i am back after a whole week (plus 2 days and a couple of hours). i know, it's crazy. anyways, let's get to business. i know everyone is obviously here for the fishing game and nothing else, so here you go. progress on the new update is going pretty well, surprisingly enough. a short peek at the changes i've made so far:
- visual changes (you can actually see the pond you're fishing in now)
- brand new ui (first ever drunkboisdev project to get a proper one, in fact)
- saving (huge!!!)

so yeah, it's been smooth sailing so far. there's still a lot i have planned, like a research system and different types of fishing tools, but i will give a tentative release date of May 6 (mark your calendars, if you care enough). generally i don't like giving release dates because it makes me feel like the World will End if i miss it, but i think 2 weeks is enough time to finish everything i want to finish.

also, not sure if you noticed, but i've taken the time to add some features to this blog, such as the correct image being loaded if you go to previous posts. i should really clean up this javascript, too. i'll probably do that after i release the new fishing update. bye!
