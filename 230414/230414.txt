hello again! i'm not going to lie, i was not expecting to have to update this so early. however, as they say, spite is the greatest motivator, so datwul sent me his code almost immediately after i posted two days ago. naturally, i did what i always do and rewrote all the javascript (plus some css and html). in addition, i changed some things according to a planning document i made a few months ago. yeah... we first bounced around the idea for a fishing idle game back in february because of a discord bot (lol???), so i made this file to store ideas. you can see some of it in the attached image. yes, it cuts off there.

by the way, if you want to see the last post, click the word "File" at the top. i would have added a dropdown and file menu, but i am in my school's compsci club as i write this and i don't have enough time to add that (i'm also busy tonight), so have this instead. honestly, i'm surprised it worked first try (if you don't count storing the post number as a constant).
until next time!!!
