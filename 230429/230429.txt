alright what's up everyone. i said i would post another update when the fishing game (still don't know what to call it) update came out, and it is basically ready to ship unless i run into 20 bugs right now, so here you go. there's lots of fun new features to make it more of an actual game and not a click button repeatedly simulator (although it is an idle game, so it's not that far off). "but wait!" i hear you say (not really). "didn't you say it was going to release on the 8th?" well, my executive dysfunction decided to take a break for a few days and i got a bunch of work done. so that was pretty awesome. anyway, some stats about the update, because i love stats:
- the file size went from 4.2kb to 19.3kb (4.6x increase!)
- the css file is 2023 bytes (this year)
- i have two planning files that cover the same thing for some reason
- this update went through at least 12 sub-updates (i say at least because i only started counting on the 22nd)
- i could have made $153 in the time it took to make this update if i spent the time working minimum wage instead

ok, when i said "ready to ship" i meant "i got all the programming done i just gotta do the art" and it has inspired a strong hatred of drawing water in me. i can probably get it done for may 1st though just trust me on this one. also i still have to playtest, make sure the cost curve makes sense, make sure there aren't any really dumb bugs (of which there are MANY i have had to iron out so far), so actually maybe later. next week for sure though mark my words.

now that that's done, the next thing on the horizon is this blog. i do want to improve it, it's just that the thought of rewriting that abhorrent rushed mess manages to deter me every time. one of these days, i will overcome it and it will be awesome. until then, not as awesome. then after that, the next fishing update. i don't have any plans besides vague ideas, so it'll be a while coming (likely late May or after). after that, who knows?

also, i had a dream last night where some kids blew up a cartoon tnt box and caused the destruction of a railroad, four bridges and a canyon. see you next time!
