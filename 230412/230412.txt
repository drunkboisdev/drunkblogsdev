hey everyone!

so i decided to start a blog of the stuff we're getting up to. not really for any reason, but i saw someone post a cooking recipe on github pages, which i thought was really funny for some reason. and then i spent my entire compsci period recreating notepad on windows 10 in css. yes, the icon is wrong because i was too lazy to look for the proper .ico file, plus the minimize/maximize/close buttons are fake. i'll probably develop it more later so things are actually functional, but i just wanted to finish the thing so i could put it up quickly. i did at least put in the bare minimum effort of making the window draggable, though.

so, what have we been up to lately? well, not much. we've "started" work on a new game based around fishing. and by that, i mean datwul has a file called "quirky fishing game.html". i have no idea what is in it or when he will inevitably send it to me to fix, but hopefully it will be up soon.

ok i just tried to add an image in a separate window and it's making me go insane because the formatting will not work and there's a tiny stupid white bar at the bottom but i'm tired so fuck it. see my ineptitude in all of its glory.
(also you can only drag it from the title text)

erm... yeah i guess that's it. see you whenever i have actual news!
